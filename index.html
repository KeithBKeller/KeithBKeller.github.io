			<h1>My Resume</h1>
				<h3>Computer Skills</h3>
				<p>Thanks to my many years of musical education and experience 
				I am able to learn very fast and think analytically. 
				I served as a teaching aide to the high school band director for 3 years 
				which helped me develop the skills to manage a group of people to achieve a task.</p>
				<br />
				<h3>Work Experience</h3>
				<p>A majority of my work experience is in fast food. However the last year and a half 
				I got the privilege to work for an IT MSP. This has allowed me to learn a variety of 
				different systems and applications</p>
				<br />
				<p>Arbys 2017-2019</p>
				<p>VOX Network Solutions 2019-2020</p>
				<p>TeamLogic IT 2020-Present</p>
				<br />
				<br />
				<p>While my work list is short, it shows that I am a loyal employee. 
				I donâ€™t like jumping around from company to company. 
				I would like to work one place for years to come so I may be able to develop my skills further 
				and become a valuable resource to the right company.</p>
