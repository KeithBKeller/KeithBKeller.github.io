			I took a video game design class and was in the top of the class. In music I played alto sax and bari sax.
			 I went to the Adams County Honor band 2 years in a row once for each insturment.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>Intrests</h3>
			<p>I have many ntrests, as stated above i enjoy programming and music. I also enjoy crafting primitive (old) weapons out of common day items. Another thing that i enjoy a lot is puzzles. With a majority of my hobbies ive found that they all involve problem solving and creating. I also enjoy spennding time with my family, friends, and 2 puppies, because who doesn't enjoy those?</p>

				<p>All of my work experience is in fast food as of right now, but I have been in the food industry for 3 years now, I work my best when I can find a rhythm and pattern, once I find that i quickly start becoming one of the fastest and most thurough in that area. Which all coding is, is patterns and rhythms in reality.</p>
